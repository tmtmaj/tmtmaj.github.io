### Research Team

* Chief of research : Soonuk Seol (suseol@koreatech.ac.kr) 
* Cooperation researcher : Cho Gyeongmin, Lee Saehan, Lee Hojae, Choi Jongho, Kim Byeonggil (http://dame.co.kr/) 
* Participating researcher : Shin Yejin, Lee Gangwon, Lee Jaeyeong, **Park Jeonghyeok**, Park Jinuk, Han Yumin

### Project Development Period

 2015.11 ~ 2016.11

### Explanation

The GuitarSolo allows a user to practice guitar without music scores by lightening LEDs on the corresponding positions at the guitar neck and provides feedback on her performance. With our smartphone app, the user can see what she is playing through the screen, record it as a music score, and share it with others through our content server. In addition, our guitar helps users do a highly efficient practice with rewind, fast-forward, tempo control, and repeat features.
### Project Development goals

* Develop IT convergence guitar that can learn various methods based on LEDs and sensors 
* Provide real-time lesson capability through exclusive practice mode and smartphone interworking 
* Build a platform that enables the production and sharing of performance content


### Project Development Contents

* Study guitar design manufacturing methods with embedded devices and electronic components and design/manufacture IT convergence guitars with high design and robustness 
* Develop embedded devices and software that utilize LEDs and sensors to provide a variety of performance methods (e.g., next playing position, finger number, note length, stroke direction, line number mark for Arpeggio, etc.) 
* Develop single-mode features that control LEDs by selecting performance files stored in embedded systems and real-time lesson functions that work with smartphones 
* Develop smartphone apps and platforms to create user-playing content and share playing content

### My Works

* Develop android application and data transfer algorithm between embedded system and application
* Search suitable sensor and Design algorithm for real-time recognition of guitar performance. 
* Design and build a prototype of a dedicated guitar (produce dedicated guitars at DAME plant in Guangzhou) 
* Design main controller (Atmel's Cortex-M3 family SAM3A8C) and develop embedded software (C / C ++ language(Arduino IDE))
